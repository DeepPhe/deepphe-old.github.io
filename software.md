# DeepPhe Software

The DeepPhe software tools use a combination of natural language processing, machine learning, visual analytics, a rich ontology and ontology-based summarization to extract longitudinal histories from cancer clinical notes.  
DeepPhe can provide summary phenotype and patient information as well as facilitate retrospective cancer cohort research. 
Built on the widely-used [cTAKES](http://ctakes.apache.org) NLP platform, DeepPhe can extract tumor characteristics, treatments, biomarkers and comorbidity information, as well as classify clinical notes in to treatment episodes.
DeepPhe can produce results many output formats, as well as store information in a graph database supported by a REST API.
