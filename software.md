# DeepPhe Software

The DeepPhe software tools use a combination of natural language processing, machine learning, visual analytics, and a rich [information model](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12911-016-0358-4) to extract longitudinal histories from cancer clinical notes and to facilitate retrospective cancer cohort research. Built on the widely-used [cTAKES](http://ctakes.apache.org) NLP pipeline, DeepPhe can extract tumor characteristics, treatments,  biomarkers, and comorbidities, as well as classify clinical notes in to treatment episodes, storing results in a graph database supported by a REST API.
