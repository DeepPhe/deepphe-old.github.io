# DeepPhe for Translational Research (DeepPhe-XN)

The complexities of cancer care create significant challenges for the extraction of information for
retrospective research. As patients progress through diagnosis to treatment and subsequent monitoring,
multiple encounters with varying specialists generate a rich set of clinical notes.
For patients undergoing lengthy or multimodal (e.g., a combination of surgery, chemotherapy,
and radiotherapy) treatment, hundreds or thousands of notes can be generated along the cancer journey.
Review of these notes can be a laborious interpretive challenge, often involving many hours of time
for medical professionals who must read through collections of notes to prepare summarized abstractions
in spreadsheets or databases. This process is also brittle, as reviews conducted for one study may 
miss items of potential interest to subsequent studies. 
Although ad hoc solutions such as the oncologic history have spontaneously developed as information
collection devices, they are not necessarily universal, accurate, or complete.
