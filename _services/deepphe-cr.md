The DeepPhe tool for Cancer Registries (DeepPhe-CR) 
builds upon the base DeepPhe platform to provide REST-APIs 
for submissions of documents to the DeepPhe pipeline and return of extracted results,
with the goal of providing DeepPhe services to tools for cancer patient data abstraction. 
Developed in support of cancer registries from the NCI
[Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program](https://seer.cancer.gov), 
DeepPhe-CR provides web-services suitable for integration into existing registry 
case abstraction tools.  
DeepPhe-CR tools are provided as a suite of Docker containers supporting ease
of installation and operation.
DeepPhe-CR has been developed in partnership with the 
[Kentucky Cancer Registry](https://www.kcr.uky.edu/).

A collaboration with the [National Cancer Institute's](https://www.cancer.gov)
[Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program](https://seer.cancer.gov) 
 (Grant #UH3CA243120).
