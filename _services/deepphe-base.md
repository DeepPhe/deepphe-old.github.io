The base DeepPhe system processes corpora of patient notes,
extracting mentions and attributes of key cancer concepts from individual notes and
integrating the information within and across documents to build a
high-level summary of a patient's case. DeepPhe also contains
machine learning trained classifiers capable of labeling individual
notes according to the phase of treatment (pre-diagnostic, diagnostic,
treatment, etc.).
