The last ten years have seen a rapid rise in the application of informatics and computer science to support the development of more effective patient treatment regimes. Underpinning this success is the need to be able to fully leverage, utilize and extract the information and knowledge residing within the electronic medical record (EMR). While the extraction of structured data elements from an EMR is relatively straightforward, retrieval of information from unstructured data, such as the clinical narrative, is decidedly more complicated. To convert that latter information in a computable and extractable form, Natural Language Processing (NLP) methodologies are called forth. It is widely agreed upon that the information retrieved from free text can significantly enhance the accuracy of any associated patient classification or phenotyping analysis.

I am among a handful of pioneering scientists developing Natural Language Processing methodologies, computational tools and algorithms to facilitating the “fracking” of the electronic medical record to support translational clinical research, precision medicine and decision making within the clinical practice. With a focus on higher level semantic and discourse processing of the clinical narrative, my research has resulted in numerous publications. It has also resulted in a pioneering open source scalable NLP platform for information extraction from the clinical narrative - clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System (cTAKES) (ctakes.apache.org). cTAKES rapid adoption and its contribution to improving health by enabling new discoveries ranging from personalized medicine to improved patient care management is extremely rewarding.
